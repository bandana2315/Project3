                        *********** VOICE BASED EMAIL SERVICE FOR VISUALLY CHALLENGED PEOPLE************



 
ABOUT THE PROJECT:-

 The project is a python-based application for visually impaired persons using speech to text 
 voice response, thus enabling everyone to control their mail accounts using their voice only and 
 to be able to send email, through their Gmail accounts.

 As the title suggests, the application will be a web-based application for visually impaired 
 persons using IVR- Interactive voice response, thus enabling everyone to control their mail 
 accounts using their voice only and to be able to send, and perform all the other useful tasks. 
 The system will prompt the user with voice commands to perform certain action and the user 
 will respond to the same.

 The main benefit of this system is that the use of keyboard is completely eliminated, the user 
 will have to respond through voice only .

1.MOTIVATION-:

 We have seen that the inception of Internet has dramatically revolutionized many fields. Internet
 has made life of people so easy that people today have access to any information they want sitting 
 at their home. One of the main fields that Internet has revolutionized is communication. And 
 talking about communication over Internet, the first thing that comes in our mind is E-mail.
 Emails are considered to be the most reliable way of communication over Internet, for sending or 
 receiving some important information. But there is a special criteria for humans to access the 
 Internet and the criteria is you must be able to see. You must be thinking that what sort of criteria 
 is this, everyone with eyes can see. But there are also specially physically challenged people in 
 our society who are not gifted with what you have. Yes there are some visually challenged people 
 or blind people who cannot see things and thus cannot see the computer screen or keyboard.
 This system is created to help the blind or partially blind people and the people who are illiterate . 
 This is the main and important motive of this system. This project is an application for a visually 
 impaired user or an illiterate user who wishes to use the email services just like any other normal 
 human being. This system will help in overcoming some of the drawbacks that were earlier faced 
 by the visually impaired people in accessing emails. Only certain keyboard shortcuts will be used in 
 this system. Other than that, the use of keyboard is eliminated. This is the major advantage since 
 there is no need to remember the location of keys on the keyboard. The main motive behind this
 is that the user need not to remember the functions on keyboard.

2. INSTALLATION:-

2.1 PYTHON 3.9 :

 First thing that we need to install in our system is python 3.9 version. You can also install 
 old version of python as well, but Python 3.9.1 is the newest major release of the Python 
 programming language, and it contains many new features and optimizations.

LINK TO DOWNLOAD PYTHON3.9-
 https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/

2.2 PYCHARM:

 PyCharm is an integrated development environment (IDE) used in computer 
 engineering, specifically for the python language. It is developed by 
 the Czech company JetBrains. It provides code analysis, a graphical debugger, an 
 integrated unit tester, integration with version control systems (VCSes), and supports web 
 development with Django as well as data science with Anaconda.
 PyCharm is cross-Platform, with Windows, macOS and Linux versions. The Community 
 Edition is released under the Apache License and there is also Professional Edition with 
 extra features – released under a proprietary license.

LINK TO DOWNLOAD PYCHARM –

2.3 PYAUDIO:

 PyAudio provides Python bindings for Port Audio, the cross-platform audio I/O library. 
 With PyAudio, you can easily use Python to play and record audio on a variety of 
 platforms.

 • Select your architecture and download Pyaudio from this link.
 • Open the terminal where you have kept your .whl file and add the following command in terminal.
 • Pip install Pyaudio-0.2.11-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl

2.4 SPEECH RECOGNITION:

 Before we get to the nitty-gritty of doing speech recognition in Python, let’s take a 
 moment to talk about how speech recognition works. A full discussion would fill a book, 
 so I won’t bore you with all of the technical details here. In fact, this section is not prerequisite to the rest of the tutorial.
 If you’d like to get straight to the point, then feel free to skip ahead.

 The first component of speech recognition is, of course, speech. Speech must be 
 converted from physical sound to an electrical signal with a microphone, and then to 
 digital data with an analog-to-digital converter. Once digitized, several models can be 
 used to transcribe the audio to text.
 Speech recognition, as the name suggests, refers to automatic recognition of 
 human speech. Several speech recognition libraries have been developed in Python. It is 
 also known as "automatic speech recognition" (ASR), "computer speech recognition", or 
 just "speech to text" (STT).

 • Open the terminal and go to your project file location and add the following command in terminal.
 • Pip install SpeechRecognition

2.5 PYTHON TEXT TO SPEECH:

 pyttsx3 is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python. Unlike alternative libraries, it works 
 offline and is compatible with both Python 2 and 3. An application invokes the pyttsx3.init() 
 factory function to get a reference to a pyttsx3. Engine instance. it is a very easy to use tool 
 which converts the entered text into speech.The pyttsx3 module supports two voices first is female and
 the second is male which is provided by “sapi5” for windows.

 PYTTSX3 is a Python library, which is a very easy library that converts the text into audio. 
 The play sound module is used to play audio files. With this module, we can play a sound 
 file with a single line of code.

• Open the terminal and go to your project file location and add the following command
in terminal.
• Pip install pyttsx3

REQUIREMENTS OF THE PROJECT:-

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:-

Tools Used:

 • Python IDLE
 • Google Speech to text and text to Speech Converters.
  Pyttsx3 text to speech api in python. 
 • PyCharM

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:-

 • Windows Desktop or Laptop.

CODING LANGUAGE:-

Conclusions:-

 The project that we have projected is a system which will help the visually impaired people to 
 access email services efficiently. 

 This system will help in overcoming some drawbacks that were earlier faced by the blind 
 people in accessing emails. We have eliminated the concept of using keyboard shortcuts along 
 with screen readers which will help reducing the cognitive load of remembering keyboard shortcuts.

 Also any non-sophisticated user who does not know the position of keys on the keyboard need 
 not bother as keyboard usage is eliminated. Instructions given by the IVR accordingly to get the respective services offered. 

 Other than this the user might need to feed in information through voice inputs when specified. 
 It is a observation that about 70% of total blind population across the world is present in INDIA. 
 This project, describe the voice mail architecture used by blind people to access Email 
 and multimedia functions of operating system easily and efficiently.
 This architecture will also reduce cognitive load taken by blind to remember and type characters using keyboard. 
 It also helps handicapped and illiterate people.
